## Description

Remember that time when you searched YouTube for something important for once... but you never reached your destination, thanks to the temptating clickbaits and other "interesting" stuff it threw your way. 

Well, if you could resist that, then its Achievement Unlocked for ya! We don't have that determination so we set out to challenge the YouTube search algorithm and made our own filter for the search results to show us only the relevant videos based on their Likes, DisLikes, Views and number of Subscribers to the Channel. We made our own UI to display those results and redirect over to YouTube, keeping it as minimal and focused as possible.
